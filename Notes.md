# SketchFoo Neural Network Manager Notes
## User Image Submission Pipeline
When a user first connects to to the web interface, they will view the available options for 
information, image submission, and feedback. 

If a user already has an image being processed for a user, they will have to wait. 

When the user submits an image, the image will be loaded into a canvas. When the image canvas is loaded,
the user can make modifications to the image if they choose to.

Once the user is satisfies with the image, that can submit it to be processed.
